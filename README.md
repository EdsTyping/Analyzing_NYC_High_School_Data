# Analyzing_NYC_High_School_Data

New York City has published data on student SAT scores by high school, along with additional demographic data sets. There is a significant immigrant population and is very diverse, so comparing demographic factors such as race, income, and gender with SAT scores is a good way to determine whether the SAT is a fair test. For example, if certain racial groups consistently perform better on the SAT, we would have some evidence that the SAT is unfair.

We'll end up combining the data and take a dive into correlations with SAT scores.
